📝 Notes Management System
🚀 Project Overview

This project is a Notes Management System that allows a single user to create, view, update, and delete notes. The system is developed using Flutter for the mobile application, following a client–server architecture, and communicates with a RESTful API built using Express.js. The backend stores data in MongoDB and supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with proper validation, error handling, and structured JSON responses.
